A Boolean Matrix Decomposition Framework


Boolean matrix decomposition is a method to obtain a compressed representation of a matrix with Boolean entries. BMaD is a modular framework that unifies several Boolean matrix decomposition algorithms, and provide methods to evaluate their performance. The main advantages of the framework are its modular approach and hence the flexible combination of the steps of a Boolean matrix decomposition and the capability of handling missing values. The framework is licensed under the GPLv3.
