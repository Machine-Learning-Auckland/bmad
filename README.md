A Boolean Matrix Decomposition Framework


Boolean matrix decomposition is a method to obtain a compressed
representation of a matrix with Boolean entries. BMaD is a modular
framework that unifies several Boolean matrix decomposition
algorithms, and provide methods to evaluate their performance. The
main advantages of the framework are its modular approach and hence
the flexible combination of the steps of a Boolean matrix
decomposition and the capability of handling missing values. The
framework is licensed under the GPLv3.
