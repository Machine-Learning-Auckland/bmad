/**
 * Contains few workarounds that allow to work with tuples and functions.
 * 
 * Classes from this package have nothing to do with boolean matrix 
 * decompositions, they are just a tribute to my inability/unwillingness 
 * to think without functions and to return multiple values in an object array.
