/**
 * Contains many different implementations of essential parts of a 
 * boolean matrix decomposition algorithm, that is: candidate generators,
 * basis selectors, and row combinators. 
 * 
 * The boolean matrix decomposition
 * algorithm is implemented in <code>BooleanMatrixDecomposition.java</code>,
 * all other classes are parts, that can be plugged into this abstract 
 * implementation.
