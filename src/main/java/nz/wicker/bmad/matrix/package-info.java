/**
 * Contains implementations of elementary data structures, required to
 * perform boolean matrix decompositions: matrices. 
 * 
 * There is an implementation
 * of a matrix that can hold values from special boolean algebras, and a 
 * generic implementation of a matrix, that can hold anything (for example 
 * Strings and other matrices).
